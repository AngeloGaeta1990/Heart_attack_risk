### Heart Risk Analysis
---
In an era marked by the increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), understanding the factors contributing to heart health and risk has become paramount. Cardiovascular diseases, encompassing conditions such as coronary artery disease, stroke, and hypertension, remain the leading cause of mortality worldwide. With lifestyle choices, genetic predispositions, and environmental factors interplaying in complex ways, the need for precise risk assessment models becomes evident.

This heart risk analysis project aims to delve into the intricate web of variables influencing cardiovascular health, employing advanced statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms. By analyzing vast datasets of anonymized patient data gathered from five different hospitals in Budapest, Zurich, Basel, Long Beach, and Cleveland, I aim to infer which variables from the dataset correlate most strongly with a high risk of myocardial infarction.

The primary objective is to provide a method capable of predicting, with at least 80% precision, which patients are at high risk. Subsequently, healthcare practitioners can proactively reach out to patients identified as high risk, offering them preventive therapies and interventions.
