### Myocardial Infarction Risk Analysis
---
In an era marked by the increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), understanding the factors contributing to heart health and risk has become paramount. Cardiovascular diseases, encompassing conditions such as coronary artery disease, stroke, and hypertension, remain the leading cause of mortality worldwide. With lifestyle choices, genetic predispositions, and environmental factors interplaying in complex ways, the need for precise risk assessment models becomes evident.

This heart risk analysis project aims to delve into the intricate web of variables influencing cardiovascular health, employing advanced statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms. By analyzing vast datasets of anonymized patient data gathered from five different hospitals in Budapest, Zurich, Basel, Long Beach, and Cleveland, I aim to infer which variables from the dataset correlate most strongly with a high risk of myocardial infarction.

The primary objective is to provide a method capable of predicting, with at least 80% precision, which patients are at high risk. Subsequently, healthcare practitioners can proactively reach out to patients identified as high risk, offering them preventive therapies and interventions.

## Business Requirements
The first business requirement is to identify which variables most strongly correlate with a high risk of myocardial infarction.

The second business requirement is to predict with at least 80% precision which patients are at high risk of having a myocardial infarction.

Phisicians will reach out to patients identified as at high risk and provide ad hoc therapies where necessary.

Key Stakeholders are : Physicians, Medical Practice, Hospitals and healthcare facilities.

Thus, the requirements are the following:
 - **Accessibility** : The tool developed will be used by physicians with no experience in coding; therefore, the interface must be accessible.

 - **Privacy**: Sensitive patient data must not be tracked, including names, last names, and email addresses.

- **Speed**: The physician should be able to add patient data and get results quickly.

- **Precision**: The method must have a precision of at least 80% to ensure that only patients at high risk of myocardial infarction are reached out to. Therefore, false positives and false negatives should be minimized.

----
## Hypothesis

In this project, the null hypothesis (H0) is the following: The database features cannot predict a high risk of myocardial infarction. The alternative hypothesis (H1) is: The database features can predict a high risk of myocardial infarction.

1. In order to predict if a patient is at high risk of myocardial infarction, I created an ML pipeline.

1. To evaluate the performance of the pipeline, the project includes a table of truth showing that precision is â‰¥ 80% on both the test and train sets.

1. I used Spearman, Pearson, and Predictive Power Score (PPS) to identify the variables that correlate the most. This allows for further research to determine if there is any biological reason to explain the correlations found.

1. Correlation and ML performance are shown through plots to make the performance and correlations clearly visible.

## ML model development

The ML model I implemented consists of two pipelines: one for data cleaning and feature engineering, and the second for feature selection and model building.

### Data Cleaning and Feature Engeenering

The data cleaning and feature engineering pipeline consists of the following steps: RandomSampleImputer, OrdinalCategoricalEncoder, and Winsorizer.

**RandomSampleInputer**. None of the features in the dataset had missing values. However, upon inspection, I noticed that approximately 20% of the values for the cholesterol feature were zeros.

![Raw data cholesterol histogram](/docs/images/raw_cholesterol_hist.png)

Therefore, I used the RandomSampleImputer to redistribute the data uniformly across the distribution. After applying the RandomSampleImputer, I obtained the following distribution:

![Random Sample inputer cholesterol histogram](/docs/images/random_sample_inputer_cholesterol.png)

**OridnalCategoricalEncoder**.  I used the OrdinalCategoricalEncoder to convert all the features of type object into numerical features. The object-type features are:
**Sex**, **ChestPainType**,**RestingECG**, **ExerciseAngina** and **ST_Slope**.


**Winsorizer**. I also noticed that the features **Cholesterol**, **Age**, **RestingBP**, and **Oldpeak** had outliers. Therefore, I applied the Winsorizer to all of them so that outliers are mapped to 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) of the values between the 25th and 75th percentiles.

![Cholesterol Winsorizer distribution](docs/images/cholesterol_winsorizer.png)

![Age Winsorizer distribution](docs/images/age_winsorizer.png)

![RestingBP Winsorizer distribution](docs/images/resting_bp_winsorizer.png)

![Oldpeak Winsorizer distribution](docs/images/oldpeak_winsorizer.png)

### ML pipeline

The ML pipeline instead consist of the following steps: **StandardScaler**, **FeatSelection**, **LogisticRegression**.

**StandardScaler**. It centers the data around the mean by subtracting the mean value of each feature from the data.

**FeatSelection**.  Fits the model to the data and selects the features based on their importance. This helps in reducing the dimensionality of the data and removing irrelevant features, which can improve model performance and reduce overfitting.

**LogisticRegression**. I used GridSearch to check which estimator would fit best with the dataset and got the following result:

![GridSearch reult](/docs/images/gridsearch_result.png)

Logistic Regression resulted in the estimator with the highest mean score. Therefore, I proceeded with hyperparameterization and model fitting. I divided the dataset into train (80% of the data) and test (20% of the data) sets.

### ML pipeline evaluation

To evaluate the pipeline, I used the confusion matrix:

 - **Train Set**

    ![Train set confusion matrix](/docs/images/confusion_matrix_train.png)


 - **Test Set**

    ![Test set confusion matrix](/docs/images/confusion_matrix_test.png)

Furthermore, I also plotted the ROC curve to measure the difference between the method I implemented and a random sampler.

![ROC curve plot](/docs/images/roc_curve_plot.png)

Taken together, the results suggest that one of the two business requirements was addressed (see [Business requirements](#business-requirements)), as the precision is >80% on both the test and train sets. Additionally, the ROC curve highlighted a significant difference in the true and false positive rates compared to a random sampler.

---

## Neural network 

I decided to also utilize a neural network approach to assess if I could achieve higher precision and recall.

### Data preparation

For data preparation, 20% of the training dataset was utilized as the validation dataset to evaluate the model's performance. The OneHotEncoder was used to convert each categorical variable into a binary categorical variable. Additionally, the Random Sample Imputer was applied to the cholesterol feature after converting all zeros to NA. Lastly, the StandardScaler was employed to ensure that all variables are on the same scale.


### Neural network model

I constructed a neural network model using TensorFlow. It defines multiple dense (fully connected) layers with ReLU activation functions. The final layer has a sigmoid activation function, suitable for binary classification tasks. Dropout layers are added after each dense layer to prevent overfitting. The model is compiled with binary cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer, with precision as the evaluation metric.


### Neural network evaluation

The following plots highlight how the loss and precision follow similar patterns for both the training and validation sets, indicating no signs of underfitting or overfitting:


![Loss plot](/docs/images/loss_plot.png)

![Precision plot](/docs/images/precision_plot.png)


Furthermore, the confusion matrix shows similar results when compared to the traditional ML model:


![Neural network confusion matrix on train set](/docs/images/confusion_matrix_neural_network_train.png)

![Neural network confusion matrix on validation set](/docs/images/confusion_matrix_neural_network_validation.png)

![Neural network confusion matrix on test set](/docs/images/confusion_matrix_neural_network_test.png)


Since I didn't observe significant improvements compared to the traditional ML model, I decided to proceed using the ML model in Streamlit.

## Correlation study

To study which features correlate the most with the risk of myocardial infarction, I used Spearman and Pearson tests, after converting all the object-type variables into numerical values with the OrdinalEncoder. Both tests ranked the features as follows:


| Rank | Feature          | Spearman Score | Pearson Score |
|------|------------------|----------------|---------------|
| 1    | ST_Slope         | 0.591913       | 0.558771      |
| 2    | ExerciseAngina   | 0.494282       | 0.494282      |
| 3    | ChestPainType    | 0.465971       | 0.459017      |
| 4    | Oldpeak          | 0.419046       | 0.403951      |
| 5    | MaxHR            | -0.404827      | -0.400421     |
| 6    | Sex              | -0.305445      | -0.305445     |
| 7    | Age              | 0.289576       | 0.282039      |
| 8    | FastingBS        | 0.267291       | 0.267291      |
| 9    | Cholesterol      | -0.139873      | -0.232741     |
| 10   | RestingBP        | 0.113860       | 0.107589      |


Both tests identified the same features as the ones that correlate the most with heart disease risk. Furthermore, I used a parallel plot to define the profile of a patient at high risk of myocardial infarction:

![Parallel plot](/docs/images/parallel_plot.png)

Here, we can see that a patient at high risk of myocardial infarction shows the following phenotype:

- **ST_Slope**. Flat or down 
- **ChestPainType**. Asymptomatic
- **ExerciseAngina**. The patient is affected by angina after physical exercise 
- **Oldpeak**. The old peak is > 0 
- **MAaxHR**. Has on average a lower heart rate

The above information can be considered by physicians to define the profile of patients at high risk of myocardial infarction.

## Dashboard design

I designed the dashboard using streamlit, and it includes fours different pages: **Project Summary**, **Myocardial infarction correlation study**, **Myocardial infarction risk analysis**, and **Myocardial infarction model evaluation**:

-   **Project summary**.  This page includes a list of jargon terms necessary to understand the project's aim. 

    ![Project summary](/docs/images/project_summary.png)


    Furthermore, it provides a description of the project's aim and a link to the README file.

    ![Project aim](/docs/images/project_aim.png)


-   **Myocardial infarction correlation study**. This summary includes the correlation study conducted in the Jupyter notebook. The use of Spearman and Pearson correlation tests revealed that the variables most strongly correlated with a high risk of myocardial infarction are: **ST_Slope**, **ChestPainType**, **ExerciseAngina**, **Oldpeak** and **MaxHR**.

    ![Myocardial infarction correlation study section 1](/docs/images/dataset_inpsect.png)

    Furthermore, the notebook allows inspection of the original dataset, provides histograms for categorical variables, and shows the distribution of numerical variables in relation to the target variable.

    ![Myocardial infarction correlation study section 2](/docs/images/variables_distribution.png)

    Lastly, it includes a parallel plot visualizing the typical profile of a patient at high risk of myocardial infarction.

    ![Myocardial infarction correlation study section 3](/docs/images/parallel_plot_page.png)

-  **Myocardial infarction risk analysis**.  This page includes a legend providing a description of each feature and its values.

    ![Myocardial infarction risk analysis section 1](/docs/images/heart_risk_analysis.png)

    The second section includes widgets where the value for each feature can be entered.

    ![Myocardial infarction risk analysis section 2](/docs/images/widgets.png)
 
    After clicking on the "Run Predictive Analysis" button, the user will receive the probability of the patient being at low or high risk of myocardial infarction.

- **Myocardial infarction model evaluation**. This page evaluates the performance of the ML model used to estimate if a patient is at high risk of myocardial infarction. The first section provides a summary of model metrics. 

    ![Myocardial infarction model evaluation section 1](/docs/images/pipeline_steps.png)


    The second section describes the steps included in the ML pipeline. The third section includes a plot showing which features are most correlated with a high risk of myocardial infarction, sorted by coefficient magnitude. 
    
    ![Myocardial infarction model evaluation section 2](/docs/images/feature_importance.png)
    
    The pipeline performance section of the page shows the confusion matrix for both the test and train sets, with precision notably higher than 80%, addressing the second business requirement [Business requirements](#business-requirements).

    ![Myocardial infarction model evaluation section 3](/docs/images/confusion_matrix.png)

    The error score section includes measures of RÂ², Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and Root Mean Squared Error.
    The last section includes the ROC curve plot, showing the difference in the true positive rate and false positive rate when the model is compared to a random sampler.

### Bugs and Fixes

1. **Error**: During deployment on Heroku, the following error message was displayed in the Heroku logs:

    ```cmd
    -----> Discovering process types
        Procfile declares types -> web
    -----> Compressing...
        !     Compiled slug size: 576.6M is too large (max is 500M).
        !     See: http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/slug-size
        !     Push failed

    ```

    **Cause**: The Heroku slug size was too large.

    **Solution**: The `xgboost` library alone has a size of approximately 260 MB. Since the `xgboost` library was not necessary to build the application, I removed it from the requirements.

1. **Error**:  During deployment on Heroku, I received the error "port not found."

    **Cause**: The port was not added as a config var on Heroku.

    **Solution**: Added the port as a config var and included `--server.port $PORT` in the Procfile.

1. **Error**:  After installing the `ppscore` library, I received the error that `Pandas` library < `2.20` was required.

    **Cause**: `ppscore==1.3.0` is not compatible with `Pandas 2.20`.

    **Solution**: Downgraded `Pandas` to `1.5.3`.

1. **Error**: `ydata-profiling 4.8.3` was not compatible with `Pandas 1.5.3`.

   **Cause**: `ydata-profiling 4.8.3` was not compatible with `Pandas 1.5.3`. The latest `ydata-profiling` version compatible with `Pandas 1.5.3` is `ydata-profiling 4.6.4`. However, `ydata-profiling 4.6.4` was not compatible with `Python 3.12.3`, but only with `Python 3.11.9`.

   **Solution**: Downgraded to `Python 3.11.9` and downgraded `ydata-profiling` to `4.6.4`.

1. **Error**:  In Streamlit, the parallel plot was showing only black lines, and the low and high-risk values were not visible.

   **Cause**: The dataset used as input did not include target variable values; for the target variables, all values were NA.

   **Solution**: I updated the dataset used as input so that the target values were listed as 0 and 1 as in the original dataset.

1. **Error**: The parallel plot was showing black lines only, and the low and high-risk values were not visible, only if the parallel plot was run without selecting the Myocardial Infarction risk per variable plot.

    **Cause**: The dataset including the target variable values was added to the function generating the Myocardial Infarction risk per variable plot.

    **Solution**:  Moved the function to have the complete dataset in the upward function.

1. **Error**: In Streamlit, the ROC curve plot was showing an area under the curve of 0.65, whereas in the Jupyter notebook, the area under the curve was 0.88.

   **Cause**: Variables to plot the ROC curve were not provided in the correct order.

   **Solution**:  Provided the variables in the correct order in the ROC curve function.

1. **Error**: Deployment on Heroku failed with the following error: Compiled slug size: 1000.7M is too large (max is 500M).

   **Cause**: The `Tensorflow` library has a size of approximately 500 MB, exceeding the limit for Heroku deployment.
   
   **Solution**: Remove the `Tensorflow` library from requirements.

### Python

I used the AutoPEP8 and Flake8 extensions in Gitpod to ensure that the Python code adheres to PEP8 rules, and no errors are reported in any `.py` file. 
However, when linting Jupyter notebooks using the `flake8-nb` package, I encountered the following warnings:

   ```bash
   jupyer_notebooks/DataCollection.ipynb#In[6]:2:2: E999 SyntaxError: invalid syntax
   ```
The linter is having trouble recognizing the cell magic `!`, but the code still adheres to PEP8 rules."
